# Sample Argparse

This is a simple demo of python's argparse module.

The script does the following:
    Look through an input csv for a list of presidents and years
    Write sentences to an output file
    The argeparse lets me pass the input and output file locations through the CLI as follows: 

`python write-presidents.py -in presidents.csv -out list.txt`
